Feature Selection 
=================

The variables selected for the "tidyDataS.txt" file come from the the "UCI HAR Dataset". That is data from experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers (19-49 years old) performing a couple of activities while wearing a smartphone on their waist that captured linear acceleration and angular velocity in 3 dimensions at a constant frequence. Linear acceleration was measured by the smartphone intern accelerator, angular velocity by the embedded gyroscope. The original variable names were changed (1) to make them more descriptive and (2) to avoid potentially analysis problems. Only varibales for mean value "mean" and standard deviation "std" are included plus an "Activity" and a "Subject" variable (see below). The data represents the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. For more information on the initial features of that database, see "features_info" included in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.
